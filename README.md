1. No proper OOP design concept has been used(Project done when I was really an newbie but I really love it).
2. This calculator is not able to evalute any mathmatical expression.
3. Due to, the limitation of value container(e.g. variable) this can't work with very learge number(more than 32 bits or 64 bits).
4. Digit limtation is 15 digit.
